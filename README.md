Loan is trickyÂ , isn't it? Determining whether a loan should be accepted or not is not a walk in the park. There is practically no absolute way to ensure if a loan will be paid. Yet, a company engaging in loan business must make loans.
Therefore, it is necessary to find a way to minimize risk (hence, loss) from loans it make.

# Objective
This model attempts to predict if a loan application will be approved or rejected based on user's inputs and certain cut-off value. This model also shows which value is the most appropriate point for a cut-off.

# Dataset
This model uses data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rikdifos/credit-card-approval-prediction). Standard cleaning and preprocessing methods are utilized for a cleaner dataset.

# Preprocessing
1. EDAs
2. Binning
3. Weight of Value (WOE) and Information Value (IV)
4. WOE as predictor value

# Modeling
1. Premilinary
2. Forward Selection

# Scoring
1. Scoreboard
2. Input data mapping
